Warning: This mod is very much a WiP project, and is still in early stages of development. 
Additionally, Glory mod is not designed around multiplayer yet, and many parts of its content are likely to break when played on multiplayer.

Glory mod is a content mod primarily aimed at completely replacing Terraria's bosses and hostile events, along with changing the game's progression.
Each replacement comes with its own theming and unique gimmicks, but also carries key features from their vanilla counterparts.
The mod's difficulty and stat scaling is significantly higher than the vanilla game, and it is heavily recommended you play the mod on Master mode.
Currently, the mod only contains 5 bosses and a small amount of additional loot dropped by each one. There is much more content planned to be added in the future.
